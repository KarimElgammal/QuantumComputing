# Playing with Braket

I herby present a set of examples around the AWS Braket SDK where I used the SDK to:
- I use the SDK to build a quantum circuit and run it on a local simulator as ilustrated in file: `./1_local_simulator.ipynb`
- I use the SDK to run the circuit on a simulator
- I use the SDK to run the circuit on a real quantum computer
- I use the SDK to get the results and analyze them

To download the braket, follow the instructions on https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python or pip it by running the following command:
```bash
pip install amazon-braket-sdk
```
